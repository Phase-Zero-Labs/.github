# Phase Zero Labs

**Disrupting pharmaceutical development to accelerate cures and improve lives.**

## Source of Truth

All organizational standards, processes, and guidelines live in **[shared-prompts](https://github.com/Phase-Zero-Labs/shared-prompts)**.

Start there for:
- [GitHub Practices](https://github.com/Phase-Zero-Labs/shared-prompts/blob/main/github-practices.md) - Repository standards and conventions
- Development workflows
- ML prompt templates

## What We Do

We develop cutting-edge tools and analyses for drug discovery and tissue engineering:

- **Organoid Technology** - Advanced 3D tissue models for drug testing
- **Computational Biology** - RNA-seq analysis, toxicity prediction, biomarker discovery  
- **Machine Learning** - AI-powered drug discovery and clinical data analysis
- **Laboratory Automation** - High-throughput screening workflows

## Teams
